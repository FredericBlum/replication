Key to datasets

full_dataset.csv	
  The main original dataset: a list of phonetic transcriptions (unicode) in table form
    Row 1: language
    Row 2: language (ISO code)
    Row 3: region
    Row 4 through 347: data
    Column 1: concept
    Column 2 through 246: data

phonetic_groups.csv
  Phonetic groups corresponding to each unicode symbol in full_dataset.csv
    "unicode": unicode symbol used in full_dataset.csv
    "ipa": the corresponding symbol in IPA phonetic transcription
    "height", "backness", ..., "gr60": phonetic groups
    "cardinal", "cardinal_ipa": the corresponding cardinal sound in unicode / ipa transcription

sound_groups_abbreviation.csv
  A list of abbreviations used for plotting purposes

models_complete.csv
  Fitted values from all models of relative frequency
    "word": concept
    "group": the value of grouping variable (e.g., high/mid/low for vowel height)
    "fit": median of the posterior distribution of the log-odds ratio of predicted to expected frequency (see main text)
    "lwr", "upr": boundaries of 95% credible interval for "fit"
    "nLangs": the number of languages that have the value in question (e.g., a low vowel) in the word for the concept in question
    "nRegions": the number of regions that the languages in "nLangs" are from
    "cardinal": over-represented cardinal sounds (defined as follows: log-odds ratio for observed - not fitted! - values is above zero), ordered from most to least over-represented
    "topCardinal": the over-represented cardinal sound that is the most common one in the word in question across all languages in terms of its absolute frequency
    "fitProp_fit", "fitProp_lwr", "fitProp_upr": fitted value and 95% CI for the proportion of "group" sound class
    "obs": observed proportion of "group" sound class averaged across all languages (the observed equivalent of the "fitProp_fit" variable)
    "obs_OR": log-odds ratio of observed to expected frequency (the observed equivalent of the "fit" variable)
    "myvar": grouping variable (e.g., vowel height)
